## About

So, if you have a community like [Figure Photography on Google+](http://goo.gl/St4Kk), and you also have the domain [figure.photos](http://figure.photos), the question becomes: **What can we do with it?**

I don't know.

Which is why this project is up on GitHub.  If you have any fun ideas for what we can do with this domain, feel join this project and contribute some fun ideas and even code worthy of the domain name :).

In the meantime, you can visit the original community and the domain via these links:
* [Figure Photography](http://goo.gl/St4Kk)
* [figure.photos](http://figure.photos)

## Contributing

The whole point of having this site on github is so that people can contribute any ideas or even actual design to the site.  Feel free to take a look and fork the project to add or change anything you want.  Then just go through the normal procedures to issue a pull request and we'll take a look to see what we can do with it.  At the moment, I (warazashi) basically have the only access to the actual server running figure.photos so once the changes are smoothed out, I'll publish it to the site.

So no need to worry about breaking anything, feel free to just run this locally on your machine.  If you need help getting setup, you can check the documentation for [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and hopefully that will help you get up and running.  A little more complicated than it has to be, but it looks like it'll provide for a lot of interesitng things that we can do with the site.

Anyway, looking forward to seeing if anyone decides to contribute, ideas or designs :).

Thanks!
