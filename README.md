figure.photos
=============

So, if you have a community like [Figure Photography on Google+](http://goo.gl/St4Kk), and you also have the domain [figure.photos](http://figure.photos), the question becomes: **What can we do with it?**

I don't know.

Which is why this project is up on GitHub.  If you have any fun ideas for what we can do with this domain, feel join this project and contribute some fun ideas and even code worthy of the domain name :).

In the meantime, you can visit the original community and the domain via these links:
